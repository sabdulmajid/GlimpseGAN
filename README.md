GlimpseGAN: Generating lifelike images using PyTorch-powered Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview

GlimpseGAN is an exciting project that explores the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. GANs are a class of deep learning models that learn to generate synthetic data, such as lifelike images, by training two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. This project showcases the beauty and potential of AI technology for creative image synthesis.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- **`generator/`:** Contains the implementation of the generator model, responsible for generating lifelike images.
- **`discriminator/`:** Contains the implementation of the discriminator model, responsible for distinguishing real images from generated ones.
- **`train_gan.py`:** Implements the GAN training loop and model evaluation, including hyperparameter settings and training configurations.

## Installation

To set up and run the GlimpseGAN project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone** the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GlimpseGAN.git
cd GlimpseGAN
```
