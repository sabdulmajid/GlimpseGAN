GlimpseGAN: Generating lifelike images using PyTorch-powered Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview

GlimpseGAN is an exciting project that explores the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. GANs are a class of deep learning models that learn to generate synthetic data, such as lifelike images, by training two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. This project showcases the beauty and potential of AI technology for creative image synthesis.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- **`generator/`:** Contains the implementation of the generator model, responsible for generating lifelike images.
- **`discriminator/`:** Contains the implementation of the discriminator model, responsible for distinguishing real images from generated ones.
- **`train_gan.py`:** Implements the GAN training loop and model evaluation, including hyperparameter settings and training configurations.

## Installation

To set up and run the GlimpseGAN project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone** the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GlimpseGAN.git
cd GlimpseGAN
```

2. **Install** the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run** the GAN training script:
```bash
python train_gan.py
```

## Usage

Once the GAN model is trained, you can use it to generate lifelike images. GlimpseGAN has been Dockerized for easy deployment and reproducibility. Additionally, you can deploy the Docker image on a Kubernetes cluster for scalable image generation.

## Dockerized Usage

To generate images using the Dockerized GlimpseGAN, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your local machine. You can install it from here: [Docker Install](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
